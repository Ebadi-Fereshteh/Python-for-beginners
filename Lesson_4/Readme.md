## Exercise programs:

1.checkerBoard.py
Write a function that reciveing m and n as parameters, prints a checkerboard with n x m dimensions.

Example output:
<img src="checkerBoard.png" />

2.quadratic_equation.py
Solving the quadratic equation. <a href="" > Tips </a>

Example output:
<img src="quadratic_equation.png" />

3.multiplication_table.py
Write a function that receiveing m and n as parameters, prints multiplication table with m x n dimensions.

Example output:
<img src="multiplication_table.png"

4.count_words.py
Write a function that receives a statement from the user and counts the number of words. Example:
input: python is a powerful programming language             
output: 6

Example output:
<img src="count_words.png" />

5.check_factorial.py
Write a program that receive a number from the user and determine that is factorial this number or not. 
if number is factorial, print "Yes" in output, otherwise print "No". Example:
input: 24       output: "Yes"
because we know 24 = 4! = 4x332x1 

Example output:

6.gcd_calculate.py
Write a program that receives two numbers from the user and calculates greatest common divisor of these numbers. (using a for loop)

Example output:

<img src="gcd_calculate.png" />

7.lcm_calculate.py
Write a program that receives two numbers from the user and calculates least common multiple of these numbers. (using a for loop) 

Example output:
