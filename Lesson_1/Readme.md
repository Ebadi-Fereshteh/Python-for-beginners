### Valid_TriangleSides.py:

Write a program that receives the size of three sides of a triangle and determines whether it is possible to draw such a triangle or not? 
(Hint: in mathematics, it is a theorem that states that in any triangle, the size of each side is smaller than the sum of the sizes of the other two sides)
